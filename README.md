# Java_Practice_Files

These are a collection of files of the projects I worked on while going through a Coursera Course facilitated by Duke University. 

CSVParser - Parses CSV Files and returns the hottest, coldest, and most humid days within a file.

Baby_names - Parses CSV Files and gathers the info of the child names within the file.

word_play - Introduced to the char data type and worked on the fundamentals of manipulating strings.

word_lengths - Categorizes words based on their length.

Caesar_cipher - Working on the fundamentals of arrays in java. Takes an input and encrypts the message based on a given key.

Object_cipher - Like Caesar_cipher except creating the functionallity within an object. Working with the basics of constructors and fields. 

word_frequency - Selects a file and stores the individual words in a string type ArrayList and the frequency of those words used are stored in a seperate ArrayList of integer type. Builds on the knowledge learned of creating objects and using constructors.

Characters_In_Play - Builds off of word_frequency project; Was built to take in a file with text from one of Shakespeares plays. Then would read the file line by line to see which character had the most speaking parts.
